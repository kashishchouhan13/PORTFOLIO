# Portfolio Website

This is my personal **portfolio website** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and achievements in the field of **Full Stack Development**. The website highlights my work in various projects, including web applications, and provides easy navigation to learn more about my expertise and experience. While the website is functional, I plan to continue improving its design and responsiveness across different devices.
